Setting up the document-hosted FDP
==================================
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
### Prerequisites
* A basic understanding of the FAIR principles
* A basic understanding of the FAIR Data Point (FDP) specification
* Familiarity with the chosen hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, AWS, or a self-hosted solution).
* Knowledge of the relevant programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, or JavaScript).

### Steps
#### Step 1: Setting up the FDP on a Hosting Platform
* The first step is to set up the FDP on a hosting platform. This can be done by creating a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or a similar platform. Alternatively, you can use a self-hosted solution. 
* Set up the necessary infrastructure to host the FDP, such as creating an account and configuring the environment. The chosen environment should be able to run cron jobs, such as GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
* Migrate your existing FDP or create a new one on the hosting platform.
* Ensure that the necessary resources (e.g., data files, metadata, and documentation) are available for hosting.

#### Step 2: Provide the metadata for the documented resources
There are three ways to provide the metadata for the documented resources:
* Mimic the FDP implemented for WikPathways. Available at https://fdp.wikipathways.org
* Follow the schema specified at: 
* Follow the FDP specification. 

#### Step 3: Registering the FDP with the FDP Index
* Register the FDP with the FDP Index. This can be done by sending a ping request to, for example, the [EJP-RD FDP Index](https://index.vp.ejprarediseases.org)
* Implement a routine "ping" mechanism to inform the index that your FDP is still online and accessible. This should be repeated at least once every two weeks. 

#### Step 4:Addressing Limitations
* Assess the limitations of your current FDP implementation.
* Identify specific areas for improvement, such as describing additional data sets, catalogs, distributions or sites.
* Automate any manual processes or consider alternative solutions to streamline the FDP's maintenance and operation.
* Consider using a software-hosted implementation of the FDP to address the limitations of the document-hosted implementation.
