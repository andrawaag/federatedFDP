Providing metadata on Wikidata to the incubator FDP
===========================
In this chapter we will describe how to provide metadata to a FDP.
We will use the [EJP-RD test FDP incubator](https://fdps.ejprd.semlab-leiden.nl) as an example, but the steps are the same for 
any instance of the FDP specification reference implementation.

In this tutorial we will be adding metadata on a collection of subsets from Wikidata. 
Wikidata is the linked-data resource of the Wikimedia foundatation, that also hosts Wikipedia. Wikidata
is a general purpose linked-data resource, that can be used to describe any concept. There is an active community maintaining 
linked data on biomedical concepts on Wikidata. Gene Wiki is a notable example of a research project that provided data on genes, proteins, diseases and chemical compounds
to Wikidata [1]. 
As a live data sets, Wikidata is a great source for linked data on life sciences. However, 
the disadventage is that being a live data set, Wikidata is not a stable data source. 
However, different methods exists to create stable subsets of Wikidata [2].

We choose to use Wikidata as an example, because it is a great source of linked data on life sciences. It is also is available through multiple methods, which makes it a great example to demonstrate the multiple facets on how metadata can be presented on a FDP.
