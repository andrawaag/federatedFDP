The EJP-RD FDP ecosystem
========================
This tutorial is written in the context of the [European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases](https://www.ejprarediseases.org/) project.
This document will explain how to use the EJP-RD FDP ecosystem to find data on rare diseases.
First we will describe the EJP-RD FDP ecosystem, then we will describe how to provide metadata of relevant EJP-RD data resources and finally
this tutorial will show how it to find data on rare diseases.

The EJP-RD FDP ecosystem consists of the following components:
* [EJP-RD FDP index]( https://index.vp.ejprarediseases.org) - The EJP-RD FDP index is the entry point for the EJP-RD FDP ecosystem. It provides metadata on all EJP-RD FDPs.
* [EJP-RD test FDP index](https://fdps.ejprd.semlab-leiden.nl) - The EJP-RD test FDP index is a sandbox instance that can act as an incubator. 

Both FDP index server can host a collection of FDPs. This tutorial will use the EJP-RD test FDP index as an example, but the steps are the same for the EJP-RD FDP index. 
We encourage the EJP-RD community to use the EJP-RD FDP index to publish their data resources. 

In this tutorial we will use the following FDP: https://wp13.fdps.ejprd.semlab-leiden.nl/ 
This FDP is a collection of data resources from the EJP-RD project, that don't have a FDP themselves yet. It is hosted on infrastructure provided by the LUMC
and maintained in the context of the EJP-RD project. Persistence beyond the lifetime of the EJP-RD project is not guaranteed. 
As such, we encourage the EJP-RD community to set up their own FDPs and publish their data resources there.
